#  Using Qlik Sense Application for Analysis of Sales at Superstore

This project involves the creation of an interactive Qlik Sense dashboard to analyze sales performance data for a retail "Superstore". The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales metrics, profit margins, customer distribution, product categories, and sales trends over time, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

Features of the project:

-Sales and Profit by State:

A scatter plot visualizes sales revenue against profit margins across different U.S. states. This helps in identifying high-performing regions and states with potential growth opportunities or underperformance.

-Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Displays essential metrics such as total quantity sold (37,873), number of customers (793), number of products (1.86k), total sales ($2.3M), total profit ($286.4k), and average discount rate (16%).

-Sales by Sub-Category:

A tree map provides insights into sales performance across various product sub-categories, including Phones, Storage, Binders, and Accessories. This visualization helps in identifying the most profitable and high-revenue-generating product lines.

-Sales by Category:

A bar chart presents a breakdown of sales by the main categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. It provides a comparative view of revenue contributions from different product categories.

-Sales Trends by Month:

A line graph tracks the monthly sales trends over time, highlighting peak sales periods and seasonal fluctuations, allowing for trend analysis and forecasting.

-Filter Options:

Interactive filters (Region, State, City, Segment, and Order Year) enable users to drill down into specific areas of interest, making the dashboard highly dynamic and user-friendly.



Purpose: The Qlik Sense dashboard is designed to empower the Superstore management team to monitor and optimize sales performance, understand customer behavior, and make strategic decisions based on data insights. By providing a visual representation of key metrics and trends, the dashboard serves as a valuable tool for identifying growth opportunities and addressing areas of concern.
